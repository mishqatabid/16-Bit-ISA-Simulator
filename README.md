# 16 Bit Intruction Set Architecture (ISA) Simulator
The ISA Simulator is a simple emulator for a hypothetical Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). It simulates basic operations such as addition, subtraction, loading values from memory into registers, and storing values from registers into memory. The simulator also includes an "END" instruction to terminate the execution.
